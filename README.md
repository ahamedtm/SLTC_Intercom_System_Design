**Two-way Intercom System**

Many institutes and business need to have some sort of communications between each  department or groups in order for them to work efficiently. Most companies use telephones to  do this but this can be a hassle as you need to reach for the receiver, enter numbers and hold  the receiver next to you in order for the microphone to capture your voice. Instead, intercoms  were introduced. Intercoms are communication devices which usually does not need a receiver  and can be used while having your hand free to do other work. In this project we make a simple  two-way intercom system using an audio amplifier, speakers, resistors, capacitors, pushbuttons, 555 IC and microphones.
